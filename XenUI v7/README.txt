to play games, make sure your files are set up as such: Xenia Root Folder > Games > Game 1 > inside here put the xex folder (the folder that has the default.xex file directly inside), your config file (toml) for that game and your png of choice (size does not matter, must be png, jpg or jpeg, a default one will be automatically applied if there isnt one found). make sure the name of the file containing default.xex is exactly the same (case sensitive) as the folder its in alongside the png and config file. cache folders will be created in the games' folder, they are not critical but do not tinker with them. for example, in Games, i have DiRT 3. in DiRT 3 there is a file folder also called DiRT 3, this second DiRT 3 contains the default.xex. to convert GoD to xex, use install content in xenia canary to install the GoD file (the one with no extension). the xex folder will be placed in the corresponding games content folder under the name '000070000'. copy the folder directly outside the default.xex, place it in your games' folder (the Games > DiRT 3 folder for example) and rename it to the same as its game/outer folder, DiRT 3. if there is a setting you want to tweak not found in the UI, simply open the games' respective toml file itself and edit there. in ImportantConfigs.txt there is a list of the line numbers (after removing all blank lines) of the configs i found most important, resolution scale, vsync, etc. you can add to this list any configs you want.
